Mycar is a simple web application with a a car-themed website. 

Inspiration
So what happened was one of my coursemate posted a graphic design about cars on the group, and i thought to myself how about i created a website about cars, 
atleast take it as a challenge to build something by myself with my own hands well yes i still had some help from chatgpt in some places i got stuck.
It also gave me ideas, it was like we were both thinking about the same thing. I want to take this as a learning project to strengthen my
front-end development skills and experiment with design ideas & im currently working on the ui/ux to have a proper idea on how the website would look.
I aim to keep improving it as my skills grow. Wish me luck guys.

What I Used:
I used html,css & bootstrap. im still working on it and other parts of the website like javascript and a other functions and features.

Future plans and ideas
This project is still growing! yeah, i know it doesnt look perfect and super coolðŸ˜…, but im working on it. Here are some planned improvements i have in mind:
- Adding animations and transitions
- Creating a cool gallery of car images
- Building a form for user inquiries or orders
- I want it to be user friendly so the user can freely interact on the website without getting confused
- Thats what i got currently in mind but the rest will flow in time
